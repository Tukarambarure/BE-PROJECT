Title of Project - IOT Based Air & Sound Pollution Monitoring System.

Introduction:

In today’s world, the continuous rise in air and sound pollution has become a serious problem.
Controlling and carefully monitoring the situation has become necessary in order to take the
necessary steps to alleviate the situation. This research has proposed an IOT-based technique for
monitoring the air quality index and noise intensity of a region. The Air Quality Index Monitoring
Module, the Sound Intensity Detection Module, the Cloud-based Monitoring Module, and the
Anomaly Notification Module are the four modules that makeup the recommended technology.
To begin with, the air quality index is calculated based on the presence of five specific air
contaminants. The sound intensity is then detected using the appropriate sensor. After that, the
Cloud-based Monitoring Module ensures the data collection process with the support of the
Raspberry Pi’s Wi-Fi module, achieving the goal of data analysis on a regular basis.

Objectives:
1) To Study Various Sensors and related technology.
2) To Study IOT for efficient communication between sensors and processor.
3) To develop low cost sensor based processor for air pollution measurement.
4) To develop a centralized supervising/monitoring system for air pollution.

Hardware Requirements:
1) Raspberry Pi
2) MQ9 (Gas Sensor)
3) LM35 (Temperature sensor)
4) Sound sensor
5) Buzzer
6) MQ135 (Gas Sensor)
7) AD Convertor.

Software Requirements:
1) Raspbian OS
2) Python IDE
3) programming Language : Python.

CONCLUSION:
The smart way to monitor environment and an efficient, low cost embedded system is 
presented with different models in this paper. In the proposed architecture functions of 
different modules were discussed. The noise and air pollution monitoring system with 
Internet of Things (IoT) concept experimentally tested for monitoring two parameters. It also 
sent the sensor parameters to the cloud (Google Spread Sheets).This data will be helpful for 
future analysis and it can be easily shared to other end users. This model can be further 
expanded to monitor the developing cities and industrial zones for pollution monitoring. To 
protect the public health from pollution, this model provides an efficient and low cost 
solution for continuous monitoring of environment.
