This is My Final Year BE Project (Graduation Batch 2022)
Title of Project - IOT Based Air & Sound Pollution Monitoring System 

Introduction:

In today’s world, the continuous rise in air and sound pollution has become a serious problem.
Controlling and carefully monitoring the situation has become necessary in order to take the
necessary steps to alleviate the situation. This research has proposed an IOT-based technique for
monitoring the air quality index and noise intensity of a region. The Air Quality Index Monitoring
Module, the Sound Intensity Detection Module, the Cloud-based Monitoring Module, and the
Anomaly Notification Module are the four modules that makeup the recommended technology.
To begin with, the air quality index is calculated based on the presence of five specific air
contaminants. The sound intensity is then detected using the appropriate sensor. After that, the
Cloud-based Monitoring Module ensures the data collection process with the support of the
Raspberry Pi’s Wi-Fi module, achieving the goal of data analysis on a regular basis.

Objectives:
1) To Study Various Sensors and related technology.
2) To Study IOT for efficient communication between sensors and processor.
3) To develop low cost sensor based processor for air pollution measurement.
4) To develop a centralized supervising/monitoring system for air pollution.

6) MQ135 (Gas Sensor)
7) AD Convertor.

Software Requirements:
1) Raspbian OS
2) Python IDE
3) programming Language : Python.
